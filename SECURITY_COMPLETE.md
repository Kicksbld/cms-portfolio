- ✅ URL validation (dangerous protocols blocked)
- ✅ Icon file validation (type, size, signature)
- ✅ Secure filename generation
- ✅ Ownership verification (already had it)

### 4. ✅ CORS Configuration - CONFIGURED
**File**: [nuxt.config.ts](nuxt.config.ts)

**Configuration Added**:
- ✅ CORS enabled for all `/api/**` routes
- ✅ Configurable allowed origins via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env variable
- ✅ Credentials support enabled
- ✅ Standard HTTP methods allowed (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)

## 🔒 Security Protections Active

### ✅ Protection Against Common Attacks

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: ✅ Input sanitization + CSP headers
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: ✅ SameSite cookies
- **SQL Injection**: ✅ Supabase parameterized queries
- **File Upload Attacks**: ✅ Multi-layer validation
- **Brute Force**: ✅ Rate limiting on auth
- **Clickjacking**: ✅ X-Frame-Options header
- **MIME Sniffing**: ✅ X-Content-Type-Options
- **Information Disclosure**: ✅ Generic error messages
- **Unauthorized Access**: ✅ Auth guard + ownership checks
- **Path Traversal**: ✅ Secure filename generation
- **Malicious URLs**: ✅ URL protocol validation

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Quick Security Tests

Run these tests to verify all security is working:

```bash
# 1. Test rate limiting
# Try 6 login attempts with wrong password → 6th should fail with 429

# 2. Test file upload validation
# Try uploading a 10MB image → Should fail
# Try uploading .exe renamed to .jpg → Should fail (magic bytes check)

# 3. Test input validation
# Try creating link with URL: "javascript:alert(1)" → Should fail
# Try project title with 1000 chars → Should fail

# 4. Test authorization
# User A try to delete User B's project → Should get 404

# 5. Test route protection
# Access /dashboard without login → Should redirect to sign-in
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login rate limit works (6 attempts → blocked)
- [ ] Register rate limit works (4 attempts → blocked)
- [ ] Invalid email rejected
- [ ] Weak password rejected (< 8 chars, no uppercase/number)
- [ ] Oversized file upload rejected (> 5MB project, > 1MB icon)
- [ ] File extension spoofing blocked (.exe renamed to .jpg)
- [ ] XSS attempts sanitized (`<script>` removed from inputs)
- [ ] Invalid URLs blocked (`javascript:alert()`)
- [ ] Path traversal blocked (`../../../etc/passwd`)
- [ ] Unauthorized resource access blocked (User A delete User B's data)
- [ ] Dashboard redirect without auth works
- [ ] CORS headers present on API responses

## 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
✅ NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
✅ NUXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
✅ NODE_ENV=production

# Optional but recommended
✅ ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` (enables secure cookies, HSTS)
- [ ] Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your production domain(s)
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enabled on your hosting platform
- [ ] Enable Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- [ ] Review and adjust rate limits if needed

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test login from production URL
- [ ] Verify secure cookies in browser DevTools (httpOnly, secure flags)
- [ ] Check security headers in browser Network tab
- [ ] Test file upload from production
- [ ] Verify CORS works from allowed origins only
- [ ] Test rate limiting in production
